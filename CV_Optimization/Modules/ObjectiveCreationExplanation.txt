Got it ‚Äî let‚Äôs zoom in on **`ObjectiveCreation.py`**, with special focus on the **multi-objective part**, since that‚Äôs the most nuanced piece of your pipeline.

# üîé **ObjectiveCreation.py Overview**

This module defines how to **score the stitching pipeline** for Optuna.
It provides two optimization modes:

1. **Single-objective (`objective`)** ‚Üí one scalar score.
2. **Multi-objective (`multi_objective`)** ‚Üí three separate normalized objectives.

---

# 1. **Scoring Building Blocks**

* **Constraint error (RMS)**

  * Measures how well the corrected coordinates satisfy SIFT displacement rules (`A¬∑x ‚âà b`).
  * Lower = better alignment to match constraints.

* **Displacement error (RMS)**

  * Measures how far corrected coordinates deviate from original stage positions.
  * Normalized by stage step size, so it‚Äôs dimensionless.
  * Lower = less distortion of original geometry.

* **Link dropout penalty**

  * Fraction of expected neighbor connections that were lost (due to insufficient matches).
  * Weighted more heavily for **cardinal directions** (up, down, left, right) than diagonals.
  * Lower = better match coverage.

* **Diagnostics (not always part of score):**

  * Overlap similarity (via NCC).
  * Number of links used vs dropped.
  * Coverage statistics.

---

# 2. **Single-Objective Mode**

**Function:** `objective(trial, ‚Ä¶)`

* Optuna samples hyperparameters (`lambda_reg`, `weight_method`, `ratio_thresh`, etc.).
* Runs the pipeline across **inner folds** (nested CV).
* Aggregates into one scalar score:

  ```text
  score = constraint_RMS + Œ± * displacement_RMS + Œ≤ * penalty
  ```
* Returns mean validation score ‚Üí Optuna minimizes it.

---

# 3. **Multi-Objective Mode**

**Function:** `multi_objective(trial, ‚Ä¶)`

Instead of collapsing everything into one score, this treats it as **three separate objectives**:

1. **Constraint RMS (dimensionless)**

   * Measures constraint satisfaction error per link.
   * Normalized to make it independent of dataset size.

2. **Normalized Displacement RMS**

   * Ratio of coordinate correction vs. expected step size.
   * Ensures fairness across datasets with different scales.

3. **Drop Penalty Rate**

   * Proportion of dropped links (0 ‚Üí no links dropped, 1 ‚Üí all links dropped).
   * Captures robustness to weak matches.

---

### üîπ How Multi-Objective Optimization Works Here

* **Algorithm:** Optuna uses **NSGA-II** (a genetic algorithm for multi-objective search).

* Instead of a single ‚Äúbest‚Äù score, it produces a **Pareto front**:

  * Each solution is **non-dominated** (no other trial is strictly better in all objectives).
  * Example: one hyperparameter set may minimize displacement error but allow slightly higher drop rate; another may minimize constraint error but distort coordinates more.

* **Result:** You get a **set of trade-off solutions**:

  * Some are good at preserving stage geometry.
  * Others are good at maximizing overlap matches.
  * Others balance both.

You (the experimenter) then **choose** based on your priority:

* If geometric accuracy is most important ‚Üí pick low displacement RMS.
* If robust matching coverage is key ‚Üí pick low drop penalty.
* If strict adherence to SIFT constraints matters ‚Üí pick low constraint RMS.

# üìä Why Multi-Objective is Valuable

* **Single-objective** forces you to choose weights (Œ±, Œ≤) in advance.
* **Multi-objective** lets the algorithm **explore trade-offs automatically**, without committing to one weighting scheme.
* Later, you can inspect the Pareto front and select the most practical compromise.

---

‚úÖ In short:
**`multi_objective`** reframes your stitching evaluation as **three competing goals** ‚Äî constraint fit, displacement preservation, and match coverage ‚Äî and uses Optuna‚Äôs NSGA-II to find a diverse set of optimal trade-offs, rather than a single ‚Äúbest‚Äù solution.

---

Do you want me to also show you **what the Pareto front might look like** (e.g., plotting simulated trade-offs between the three objectives)? That could help visualize why this multi-objective setup is powerful.
